**Dataset**
The dataset used for this EDA project is the Global Terrorism Database (GTDB), which provides detailed information about terrorist incidents worldwide. The dataset includes various attributes such as the year of the incident, location, attack type, target type, number of casualties, and more.

**Project Structure**
The repository is structured as follows:

data/: Contains the terrorism dataset in CSV format.
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA process, code, visualizations, and analysis.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

**Analysis Steps**
Data Preprocessing:
Loading the dataset.
Handling missing values and data cleaning.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualizing the distribution of attacks over time.
Analyzing attack types, target types, regions, etc.
Exploring casualty counts, trends, and patterns.
Geographical analysis using maps and scatter plots.

**Findings and Insights:**
Identifying hotspots for terrorist activities.
Uncovering trends in attack methods and targets.
Analyzing the impact of terrorist incidents over time.
Findings and Insights
The analysis revealed several key insights:
The frequency of terrorist incidents has varied over the years, with some noticeable spikes.
Certain regions and countries are more prone to terrorist attacks than others.
The most common attack types and target types were identified.
Casualty counts were analyzed to understand the impact of attacks.

**Tools and Libraries**
The EDA was conducted using the following tools and libraries:
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Plotly

**Usage:**
To run this EDA project on your local machine:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terrorism-eda.git
Navigate to the notebooks directory.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file and run each cell to reproduce the analysis.
